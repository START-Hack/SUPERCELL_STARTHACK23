## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

In an ideal situation, when a player is facing harmful, hurtful, dangerous, or problematic behaviour (we’ll call this collectively _disruptive_ going forward), either the person who is being targeted or someone who is witness to this behaviour will alert a moderator through some sort of reporting.

In reality, it’s not always that simple!

Sometimes a player is targeted in such a way that they feel threatened and isolated, other times they may not understand the insidious nature of the disruptive behaviour. In both cases, it’s unlikely that the behaviour will be reported, and therefore challenging to address.

This is a challenge in physical spaces as well, but in those physical spaces we have a few queues that we’ve developed in society to look out for. For example, on the playground we look for a vulnerable person who has been isolated in the corner of the field by the class bullies. In some societies, we’re careful to build lines of site to where we feel vulnerable people might be cornered, such as lonely alleys or under bridges.

In the digital space, we have plenty of signals, but trying to make sense of the signals is the challenge. We have things like tracked play-patterns, record of chat, certain types of behaviours (when they log in/off), who else is around, general sentiment of chat... and more. There are dozens of companies out there promising that AI can solve this, but we’re not there yet! In the meantime, we need to understand how to use the signals available in a user-friendly way to alert humans that something is going on.

To be clear, we have this mostly solved when it comes to using two players’ chat records when it comes to things like hateful, racist, or overtly sexual content. We’re looking to solve for the things that can’t be easily surfaced through chat alone.
